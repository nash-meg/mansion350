# Sinister Happenings at Huxley Manor
This project is a text-based, choose your own adventure game. Players will attempt to escape from a spooky mansion with different options for rooms to go in, items to pick up, and actions to, hypothetically, defend themselves from attacks. There are very little graphics because wanted our words to guide users’ imaginations as each player knows how to scare themselves better than we ever could. 

When playing this game, users will read the story and choose from a handful of actions at specific moments to determine what happens next. Some of these options will allow them to continue through the escape, but some may result in death. To select an option, players should click a choice button on the right of their screen.

The one graphic users do get is a map. Players can pull up this map during given opportunities by clicking the respective button. While the map button is always present, sometimes the player is not allowed to look at it to keep the game suspense high.

We hope you enjoy, good luck, and don’t kick the cat.

Also, as a warning, this game contains themes of gore, violence, and manipulation/mind control.
